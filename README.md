# PEP XXX: Optional Code Signature Enforcement for Python

## Abstract

This PEP proposes adding optional cryptographic signature verification to Python's import and execution system. When enabled, Python would verify embedded signatures in source files and their dependencies before executing code, providing a defense against remote code execution attacks through both filesystem vulnerabilities and unsanitized input processing. This security feature can be implemented either as an opt-in configuration for standard Python or as a separate executable that enforces signatures by default, preserving Python's ease of use while enabling organizations to enforce code integrity in security-critical environments.

## Motivation

Python's flexibility and ease of use have made it ubiquitous in enterprise environments, from web servers to data analysis pipelines to system administration scripts. However, this same flexibility creates multiple attack vectors that current security approaches fail to adequately address.

The most obvious attack vector involves filesystem-based vulnerabilities. When attackers gain the ability to write files to a Python environment through web application vulnerabilities, supply chain attacks, or compromised deployment processes, they can immediately execute arbitrary code since Python treats all syntactically valid scripts as executable. This creates a direct path from file system compromise to code execution.

A second, equally dangerous attack vector involves unsanitized input processing. Python applications frequently process user input through functions like `eval()`, `exec()`, `import()`, or `__import__()`. When this input is not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious Python code that executes with the application's privileges. Traditional input validation approaches are error-prone and frequently bypassed through clever encoding or injection techniques.

Current security approaches focus on preventing these attacks at their source: restricting file system access and sanitizing all input. While important, this creates single points of failure. If an attacker bypasses file system restrictions or finds an input validation flaw, they immediately gain full code execution capabilities. This proposal adds a fundamental second layer of defense that separates the ability to provide code from the ability to execute code.

The core insight is that in security-critical environments, only cryptographically verified code should execute, regardless of how that code arrived in the system. Whether an attacker writes a malicious script to disk or injects malicious code through an input field, the Python interpreter should refuse to execute unsigned code when signature enforcement is enabled.

## Rationale

Traditional approaches to Python security have significant limitations that become apparent when we examine the full threat landscape. Restricted execution environments like `rexec` and `Bastion` were removed from Python due to fundamental security flaws that made them ineffective against determined attackers. Sandboxing solutions like Docker containers protect at the process level but don't prevent execution of unsigned code within the sandbox boundaries. Operating system-level controls can restrict file execution but often lack the granularity needed for script-heavy environments and provide no protection against code injection through application inputs.

Input sanitization approaches, while necessary, are notoriously difficult to implement correctly. The complexity of Python's syntax, combined with its dynamic features like string formatting, metaclasses, and import hooks, creates numerous opportunities for attackers to bypass validation. Even experienced developers regularly introduce input validation vulnerabilities, and the consequences of a single mistake can be catastrophic.

Code signing addresses these limitations by creating a cryptographic trust boundary that operates independently of the attack vector. Whether malicious code arrives through file system compromise, input injection, supply chain attacks, or any other mechanism, the signature verification system provides a consistent defense. The approach has proven effective in other contexts: Windows Authenticode for executables, PowerShell execution policies for scripts, and Docker Content Trust for container images. This proposal brings similar capabilities to Python while maintaining backward compatibility and ease of development.

The flexibility of implementation is crucial to adoption success. Organizations with strict security requirements can deploy a dedicated secure Python executable that enforces signatures by default, providing immediate protection without configuration complexity. Meanwhile, organizations with mixed security requirements can enable signature enforcement selectively in their existing Python installations. This dual approach ensures that the security enhancement fits naturally into diverse operational environments.

A critical aspect of this design is that signed code maintains universal compatibility. Code signed according to this specification will execute normally in any Python environment, whether signature enforcement is enabled or not. This allows developers to sign their code once and deploy it across environments with different security postures. However, unsigned code cannot execute in signature-enforcing environments, creating a clear security boundary.

## Specification

### Signature Format

Python files may include an optional signature embedded as a specially formatted comment at the beginning of the file. The signature format follows this structure:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# PY-SIGNATURE: <base64-encoded-signature>
# PY-SIGNER: <signer-identifier>
# PY-TIMESTAMP: <ISO-8601-timestamp>
# PY-ALGORITHM: <signature-algorithm>

# Regular Python code begins here
import sys
print("Hello, secure world!")
```

The signature is calculated over a normalized version of the source code. Normalization removes signature-related comments, standardizes whitespace, and eliminates formatting differences that don't affect code semantics. This allows developers to modify comments, adjust indentation, and make cosmetic changes without invalidating signatures, which is essential for maintaining normal development workflows.

### Signature Calculation Process

The signature calculation follows these steps to create a canonical representation of the code that focuses on semantic content rather than formatting details:

First, normalization removes signature-related comments, specifically any lines beginning with `# PY-SIGNATURE`, `# PY-SIGNER`, `# PY-TIMESTAMP`, and `# PY-ALGORITHM`. The process then standardizes line endings to Unix format and removes trailing whitespace from each line. Multiple consecutive blank lines are collapsed into a single blank line, ensuring that spacing variations don't affect the signature while preserving the logical structure of the code.

Second, canonicalization converts the normalized source to UTF-8 bytes and calculates a SHA-256 hash of these bytes. This hash serves as the input to the signing process, ensuring that signature generation is deterministic and reproducible.

Third, the signing process generates a cryptographic signature of the hash using the specified algorithm. The initial implementation supports RSA-2048 and ECDSA-P256, providing a balance between security strength and performance characteristics.

Finally, encoding converts the signature to base64 format for embedding in the source file as a comment, ensuring that the signature doesn't interfere with Python's parsing while remaining easily extractable.

### Verification Process

When signature enforcement is enabled, Python performs verification during both the import process and direct execution. This comprehensive approach ensures that all code execution paths are protected, whether code is loaded as modules, executed as scripts, or invoked through dynamic mechanisms.

The verification process begins with signature extraction, parsing the file header to identify and extract signature-related comments. When no signature is present and enforcement is enabled, the system immediately rejects execution with a clear error message indicating that signed code is required.

Next, normalization applies the same process used during signing to generate a canonical representation of the code. This step is critical because it ensures that cosmetic changes made after signing don't invalidate the signature while maintaining cryptographic integrity of the actual executable content.

Verification then checks the signature against the normalized code using the appropriate public key from the configured trust store. The system supports multiple signature algorithms and key formats, allowing organizations to choose cryptographic parameters that match their security policies and compliance requirements.

If verification succeeds, execution proceeds normally with no performance impact on the running code. If verification fails, the system raises a `SignatureError` with detailed information about the failure reason and halts execution immediately, preventing any unsigned code from running.

### Dependency Verification

A crucial security requirement is that signature enforcement extends to all dependencies and dynamically loaded code. When signature enforcement is active, the system verifies signatures for all imported modules, packages loaded through `importlib`, and any code executed through dynamic mechanisms like `eval()` or `exec()`. This comprehensive approach prevents attackers from bypassing signature requirements by introducing malicious code through dependencies that the primary developer might not directly control or notice.

The dependency verification process ensures that an attacker cannot compromise a signed application by providing malicious unsigned dependencies. When a signed script attempts to import an unsigned module in a signature-enforcing environment, the import fails with a clear error message. This forces all code in the execution chain to be properly signed, creating a complete trust boundary around the application.

This approach is particularly important for supply chain security. Attackers often target dependencies rather than primary applications because dependency code is less scrutinized and may be updated more frequently. By requiring all dependencies to be signed, the system prevents attackers from injecting malicious functionality through compromised packages or dependencies.

The system handles complex dependency scenarios gracefully. When a signed package imports another signed package, verification succeeds and execution continues normally. When unsigned packages import other unsigned packages in a non-enforcing environment, execution proceeds as usual. However, any attempt to mix signed and unsigned code in an enforcing environment results in immediate failure, maintaining the integrity of the trust boundary.

### Implementation Options

This proposal can be implemented through two complementary approaches that serve different organizational needs and deployment scenarios.

The first approach involves extending the standard Python interpreter with optional signature enforcement capabilities. This implementation adds command-line flags and environment variables that enable signature verification for existing Python installations. Organizations using this approach can selectively enable signature enforcement for specific applications, environments, or execution contexts while maintaining full compatibility with existing unsigned code in other scenarios.

The second approach involves creating a separate Python executable, such as `spython` (Secure Python), that enforces signatures by default. This dedicated executable would be functionally identical to standard Python but would require all executed code to be properly signed unless explicitly configured otherwise. This approach provides immediate security benefits without requiring complex configuration and clearly signals to developers and operators that they are working in a security-enforced environment.

Both approaches share the same underlying signature format and verification logic, ensuring that code signed for one environment works seamlessly in the other. The choice between approaches depends on organizational security policies, operational complexity preferences, and the desired balance between security and flexibility.

The dual implementation strategy acknowledges that different organizations have different security maturity levels and operational constraints. Some organizations prefer gradual adoption through configurable enforcement in existing systems, while others prefer the clarity and simplicity of a dedicated secure execution environment.

### Configuration

Signature enforcement is controlled through several mechanisms that provide flexibility for different deployment scenarios and organizational requirements.

Environment variables provide the simplest configuration method. `PYTHON_REQUIRE_SIGNATURES` enables signature enforcement when set to `1` or `true`. `PYTHON_SIGNATURE_KEYSTORE` specifies the path to a directory containing trusted public keys in PEM format. These environment variables work consistently across both standard Python with enforcement enabled and dedicated secure Python executables.

Command-line options offer per-execution control over signature enforcement. The `--require-signatures` flag enables signature enforcement for a specific Python invocation. The `--signature-keystore=PATH` option specifies the location of trusted public keys. These command-line options are particularly useful for testing signature enforcement or for scripts that need different security policies than the system default.

The configuration system also supports policy-based enforcement that allows fine-grained control over signature requirements. Organizations can specify different policies for different code paths, such as requiring signatures for network-accessible scripts while allowing unsigned code in isolated development environments. This flexibility enables organizations to implement signature enforcement gradually while maintaining operational efficiency.

### Key Management

The system supports multiple key formats and sources to integrate smoothly with existing organizational security infrastructure. File-based keystores use directories containing PEM-format public keys, with key files named by their fingerprint or identifier for efficient lookup during verification. This approach works well for smaller deployments and development environments.

For larger organizations, the system integrates with existing PKI infrastructure, including Windows Certificate Store, macOS Keychain, and Linux certificate authorities. This integration allows signature enforcement to leverage existing key distribution, rotation, and revocation mechanisms that organizations already understand and maintain.

The policy framework enables sophisticated key management scenarios. Organizations can configure different trusted signers for different types of code, implement key rotation schedules, and define fallback verification procedures for emergency scenarios. This flexibility ensures that signature enforcement enhances security without creating operational bottlenecks.

### Error Handling

The system provides clear, actionable error messages that help developers and operators understand and resolve signature verification issues quickly. When signature verification fails, the error messages include specific information about the failure reason and practical steps for resolution.

Missing signature errors clearly indicate that code signature requirements are not met: "Code signature required but not found in example.py. Use signing tools to add a signature or disable enforcement for development environments." This message helps developers understand both the immediate issue and potential solutions.

Invalid signature errors provide information about verification failures: "Code signature verification failed for example.py. The file may have been modified after signing or the signature may be corrupted." These messages help distinguish between legitimate signature issues and potential tampering attempts.

Unknown signer errors address trust relationship problems: "Code signature from untrusted signer 'user@example.com' in example.py. Add signer to trusted keystore or update signature policy." This guidance helps operators understand how to resolve trust configuration issues.

### Development Tools

A companion tool handles signature generation and verification for developers, making the cryptographic aspects transparent to normal development workflows. The tool supports common development tasks like signing individual files, verifying signatures across directory trees, and generating key pairs for development use.

The signing command creates signatures for Python files: `python-sign --key private-key.pem --sign example.py`. This command handles the normalization, signing, and embedding process automatically, ensuring that developers don't need to understand cryptographic details.

The verification command checks signatures across codebases: `python-sign --verify --recursive src/`. This capability is essential for continuous integration pipelines and code review processes, allowing teams to verify signature integrity as part of their normal quality assurance procedures.

Key generation supports development workflows: `python-sign --generate-key --output my-signing-key`. This command creates appropriate key pairs for development and testing, with clear guidance on key management best practices.

Development environment integration allows IDEs and editors to automatically sign files when saving, making the signature process as transparent as automatic code formatting. This integration is crucial for developer adoption, as it eliminates the friction that could otherwise discourage use of signature enforcement.

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

This proposal addresses several critical threat scenarios that current Python security approaches handle inadequately. Understanding these scenarios helps clarify both the benefits and limitations of signature enforcement.

Remote code execution prevention represents the primary security benefit. Attackers who gain file write access through web application vulnerabilities, compromised deployment processes, or supply chain attacks cannot execute arbitrary Python code without valid signatures. This creates a significant barrier between filesystem compromise and code execution, forcing attackers to either obtain signing keys or find alternative attack paths.

Input injection protection provides defense against code injection attacks through application interfaces. When applications process user input through `eval()`, `exec()`, or dynamic import mechanisms, signature enforcement prevents execution of unsigned code regardless of how cleverly the input is crafted. This protection is particularly valuable because input sanitization is notoriously difficult to implement correctly.

Supply chain protection addresses the growing threat of malicious packages and compromised dependencies. When signature enforcement is active, all imported modules must be properly signed, preventing attackers from introducing malicious code through compromised packages or dependencies that the primary developer might not directly scrutinize.

Lateral movement limitation restricts attackers who compromise one system from easily deploying and executing Python-based tools on other systems in the network. Without access to appropriate signing keys, compromised credentials alone are insufficient to execute code in signature-enforcing environments.

### Security Boundaries

Understanding the limitations of signature enforcement is crucial for making informed security decisions. The system provides strong protection within its design parameters but cannot address all possible attack scenarios.

Interpreter compromise represents a fundamental limitation. Attackers with sufficient privileges to modify the Python interpreter itself or its signature verification components can bypass signature enforcement entirely. This limitation emphasizes the importance of protecting the execution environment through complementary security measures like operating system hardening and access controls.

Key compromise creates obvious security risks. If signing keys are compromised, attackers can sign malicious code that will pass verification checks. Proper key management, including secure key storage, regular rotation, and prompt revocation procedures, is essential for maintaining the security benefits of signature enforcement.

Runtime manipulation through Python's dynamic features may circumvent signature checks in some scenarios. Code that uses `eval()` with attacker-controlled input can potentially execute unsigned code if the input sanitization is inadequate. However, signature enforcement still provides significant protection by ensuring that the primary code path and all imported dependencies are verified.

Privilege escalation attacks that allow attackers to modify the signature verification configuration or keystore can undermine the security benefits. Organizations must protect signature enforcement configuration and key management infrastructure with appropriate access controls and monitoring.

### Implementation Security

The verification implementation must be robust against sophisticated bypass attempts and implementation vulnerabilities. Several design principles ensure that the signature verification process maintains its security properties under attack.

Early verification ensures that signature checks occur before any user code execution, preventing bypass attempts through Python's dynamic features or import hooks. The verification process is integrated into the core import and execution mechanisms, making it difficult for attackers to circumvent through alternative code loading paths.

Atomic operations prevent race conditions during signature verification and file modification. The normalization and verification process handles the entire file as a single unit, preventing time-of-check-time-of-use vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to modify files between signature verification and code execution.

Memory safety requirements dictate that cryptographic operations use well-tested libraries like OpenSSL rather than custom implementations. This approach reduces the risk of implementation vulnerabilities in the signature verification code while leveraging cryptographic implementations that have undergone extensive security review.

Comprehensive coverage ensures that signature verification applies to all code execution paths, including direct script execution, module imports, dynamic imports through `importlib`, and code execution through `eval()` and `exec()`. This comprehensive approach prevents attackers from finding unprotected execution paths.

## Performance Impact

Signature verification introduces minimal performance overhead that is acceptable for most deployment scenarios. Understanding the performance characteristics helps organizations make informed decisions about enabling signature enforcement.

Startup cost represents the primary performance impact. Verification occurs once during module import, adding approximately 1-5 milliseconds per file depending on signature algorithm, key size, and system performance characteristics. For typical applications with dozens of modules, this translates to a startup delay of less than 100 milliseconds.

Memory usage increases are minimal, consisting primarily of cached public keys and verification state information. The memory footprint typically increases by less than 1MB for applications with hundreds of signed modules, which is negligible for modern systems.

Runtime performance remains unaffected once verification is complete. The signature verification process occurs entirely during code loading, with no ongoing performance impact during code execution. Applications experience no performance degradation in computational loops, I/O operations, or other runtime activities.

Performance measurements on typical Python applications show less than 1% increase in total startup time when signature enforcement is enabled. This minimal impact makes signature enforcement suitable for performance-sensitive applications while providing significant security benefits.

## Backward Compatibility

This proposal maintains complete backward compatibility to ensure smooth adoption and minimize disruption to existing Python deployments and development workflows.

Default behavior preserves existing functionality. Signature enforcement is disabled by default in standard Python installations, ensuring that existing scripts and applications continue working without modification. Organizations can enable signature enforcement selectively without affecting other Python usage on the same systems.

Graceful degradation ensures that unsigned files execute normally when enforcement is disabled, while signed files execute normally regardless of enforcement settings. This compatibility model allows developers to begin signing code immediately without waiting for infrastructure changes or coordinated rollouts.

Standard library compatibility requires no changes to Python's standard library APIs or language semantics. The verification system operates at the import and execution level without affecting Python syntax, built-in functions, or standard library behavior. Existing code continues to work exactly as before.

Cross-environment compatibility ensures that signed code executes correctly in any Python environment, whether signature enforcement is enabled or not. This universal compatibility allows developers to sign code once and deploy it across diverse environments with different security configurations.

## Migration Path

Organizations can adopt signature enforcement gradually through a phased approach that minimizes operational disruption while maximizing security benefits.

Phase one involves voluntary signing, where developers begin signing critical scripts and modules without enabling enforcement. This phase allows testing of signing workflows, identification of integration issues, and training of development teams on signature management practices. During this phase, both signed and unsigned code execute normally, providing a safe environment for experimentation and process refinement.

Phase two introduces selective enforcement in specific high-risk environments such as production servers, customer-facing applications, or systems processing sensitive data. This selective approach allows organizations to gain security benefits in critical areas while maintaining flexibility in development and testing environments. The dual compatibility model ensures that signed code from development environments executes correctly in production environments with enforcement enabled.

Phase three expands enforcement to cover all Python execution in security-critical contexts, with unsigned code limited to isolated development and testing environments. This comprehensive coverage provides maximum security benefits while maintaining operational flexibility where needed.

Throughout all phases, tooling evolution supports the adoption process. Development tools and CI/CD pipelines gradually integrate automatic signing capabilities, reducing the operational burden on developers and making signature management as transparent as other code quality processes like linting or formatting.

## Impact on Python Ecosystem

This proposal enhances Python's suitability for security-critical applications while preserving the characteristics that have made Python successful across diverse use cases.

Enterprise adoption benefits significantly from signature enforcement capabilities. Organizations with strict security requirements, such as financial institutions, healthcare providers, and government agencies, can confidently deploy Python applications knowing that unauthorized code cannot execute. This enhanced security posture opens new opportunities for Python adoption in previously restricted environments.

Cloud security improvements allow cloud platforms to offer Python execution environments with signature enforcement, providing additional security guarantees to customers. These enhanced environments can command premium pricing while reducing security risks for both providers and customers.

Supply chain trust mechanisms benefit from the foundation that signature enforcement provides. While this PEP focuses on individual file signing, it creates infrastructure that could later extend to package-level signing, creating end-to-end trust chains from development through deployment and distribution.

Educational value remains preserved through the optional nature of signature enforcement. Python's accessibility for learning and rapid prototyping continues unchanged, while providing opportunities to teach important security concepts through practical signature management exercises.

Development workflow integration becomes increasingly seamless as tools evolve to support automatic signing. Modern development environments can handle signature management transparently, making security enhancement invisible to developers while providing substantial protection against various attack scenarios.

## Conclusion

Optional code signature enforcement addresses critical security gaps in Python's execution model by providing cryptographic verification of code integrity across all execution paths. The comprehensive approach protects against both filesystem-based attacks and input injection vulnerabilities, creating a robust second layer of defense that operates independently of the attack vector.

The dual implementation strategy, supporting both configurable enforcement in standard Python and dedicated secure execution environments, ensures that the enhancement fits naturally into diverse organizational contexts. The universal compatibility of signed code allows developers to enhance security without sacrificing flexibility or creating deployment complexity.

By requiring all dependencies to be signed when enforcement is active, the system prevents sophisticated supply chain attacks and ensures complete trust boundary coverage. This comprehensive approach addresses one of the most challenging aspects of application security: ensuring that security policies apply consistently across all code in the execution environment.

The opt-in nature of signature enforcement ensures that Python's core strengths in education, rapid prototyping, and accessible development remain unchanged. Organizations can adopt signature enforcement at their own pace, gaining security benefits where needed while maintaining operational flexibility elsewhere.

This enhancement positions Python as a more viable option for enterprise and security-conscious deployments while preserving the accessibility and flexibility that have made Python successful across diverse use cases. The foundation created by this proposal enables future security enhancements and provides a model for bringing enterprise-grade security capabilities to interpreted languages without sacrificing their essential characteristics.

## Next Steps

The implementation of this proposal would follow a structured development and deployment process focused specifically on individual file signature verification. Understanding the implementation path helps clarify the immediate steps needed to bring this security enhancement to Python.

### Implementation Phases

The initial implementation phase would focus on establishing the core signature verification infrastructure within Python itself. This involves developing the normalization algorithms that create canonical representations of Python source code, integrating cryptographic verification into the import system so that signature checks happen automatically during module loading, creating the development tools that allow developers to sign and verify files easily, and establishing the configuration mechanisms that allow organizations to enable enforcement selectively. The reference implementation would demonstrate all core functionality and provide comprehensive test coverage for security-critical components.

The second phase would concentrate on ecosystem integration and tooling maturation. Development environment plugins would make signing transparent to developers by automatically handling signature generation when files are saved, continuous integration systems would incorporate signature verification into automated testing pipelines to catch unsigned code before deployment, and documentation would help organizations understand how to deploy signature enforcement effectively. This phase focuses on reducing the operational friction that could otherwise limit adoption of the security enhancement.

The third phase would introduce advanced policy and key management features for enterprise deployments. Organizations would gain capabilities for fine-grained signature policies that allow different security requirements for different types of code, integration with hardware security modules for high-security key storage, support for certificate hierarchies and delegation that enable complex organizational trust structures, and automated key rotation mechanisms that maintain security without operational burden. These enterprise-grade features enable signature enforcement to scale from individual development teams to large organizations with complex security requirements.

### Future Extension Possibilities

While this proposal focuses specifically on individual file signature verification, the infrastructure it creates establishes a foundation that could enable much more comprehensive security enhancements in future proposals. The most significant potential extension would be implementing ecosystem-wide dependency notarization and signature management, though such a system would require its own separate proposal due to the additional complexity and infrastructure requirements involved.

A future dependency notarization system could work similarly to how modern operating systems handle application signing and verification. Just as Apple's notarization system allows the company to revoke signatures for malicious applications and prevent them from running on user systems, a Python package signature authority could provide similar protections for the entire Python ecosystem. When security researchers discover vulnerabilities or malicious behavior in Python packages, signatures for affected versions could be revoked automatically, causing Python installations to refuse to import the compromised code.

The immediate benefits of such a system would be transformative for supply chain security. Instead of waiting weeks or months for developers to manually update vulnerable dependencies, the response to security issues could be automatic and immediate. When a critical vulnerability is discovered in a widely-used package, signature revocation could protect applications across the entire ecosystem without requiring any action from individual developers.

However, implementing dependency notarization would require addressing numerous additional challenges beyond those covered in this proposal. A signature authority would need substantial infrastructure for analyzing packages, issuing signatures, and distributing revocation information. The economic model for funding such a service would need careful consideration. Privacy concerns about package usage tracking would need to be addressed through techniques like private information retrieval. Integration with existing package managers would require significant coordination across multiple projects and organizations.

The technical complexity alone would justify a separate proposal. While individual file signing requires only local cryptographic operations, dependency notarization would involve distributed signature registries, real-time revocation checking, transparent logging systems for accountability, and sophisticated policies for handling different types of security issues. The scope and implications of such a system extend far beyond what this proposal addresses.

Nevertheless, the signature format and verification infrastructure established by this proposal would provide an excellent foundation for future dependency notarization efforts. The normalization algorithms, cryptographic verification logic, and key management systems developed for individual file signing could be extended and enhanced to support ecosystem-wide signature verification. This forward compatibility ensures that organizations investing in signature enforcement today would be well-positioned to benefit from future security enhancements.

The step-by-step approach of starting with individual file signing and potentially extending to dependency notarization mirrors successful security technology adoption patterns in other domains. Web security evolved from individual certificate verification to comprehensive certificate transparency systems. Mobile application security started with basic code signing and evolved to include comprehensive app store review and automatic malware detection. Python's security infrastructure could follow a similar evolution, beginning with the solid foundation that individual file signature verification provides.

Other potential future extensions could include runtime integrity monitoring that verifies imported modules haven't been modified in memory after loading, supply chain analysis tools that trace the complete provenance of all code in an application, and cross-language signature standards that bring similar security benefits to other interpreted languages. Each of these capabilities builds on the cryptographic infrastructure that this proposal would establish, demonstrating the strategic value of implementing signature verification as a foundational security technology.

The implementation of signature enforcement in Python would represent a significant advancement in interpreted language security, establishing principles and infrastructure that could serve as a model for other programming languages and enable future security enhancements that we can envision today but would require separate proposals to implement responsibly.
